                <h3>Form Design</h3>
                <date>October 14th, 2025</date>
                <p>Design plays an important role in how users interact with forms and influences their likelihood of completing it. Things such as form length, order of questions, clear labelling, and feedback can make or break an experience. When designing a form, it is important to consider how likely users will fill out each section or potentially make a mistake. Some ways to reduce cognitive overload are providing visual feedback, ordering easier questions first, and following established accessibility patterns. </p>

                <p>An online form that I've previously interacted with was a survey created on Google Forms. While surveys can vary greatly by who created them, I think that Google Forms follows best practices through its visual design patterns such as clear labelling of required fields and following a one column layout. Google Forms also offers the option to have multiple steps within a form.</p>

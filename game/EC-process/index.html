            <h3>Usability Testing Script</h3>
            <p>Hello _______, thank you for helping me out with usability testing for my game project. During this meeting, you will be trying out my game with your main task being to complete one full game of blackjack. Please try to start a game, place a bet, and complete a full game. Feel free to explore other interactions on the webpage as well.</p>
             <p>
                you go about completing the task, I’ll ask you to think aloud as much as possible: to describe what you’re looking at and what you’re trying to do.
            </p> 

            <h3>Follow up questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you describe your experience navigating through the game?</li>
                <li>Were there any parts you found confusing?</li>
                <li>Was it difficult to understand how to play blackjack?</li>
                <li>What were your thoughts on the overall UI and graphics? Was there anything that was unclear, or something you’d change?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Users: Manny, Max, Ella</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All interviewees thought navigating through the game was straightforward</li>
                <li>Manny had a hard time reading some numbers with the pixelated font</li>
                <li>Ella reached 0 carrots and was unable to continue playing unless she refreshed the page fully</li>
                <li>Feedback on UI: clean, minimal, enjoyed bunny theme</li>
                <li>Previous knowledge of Blackjack varied between interviewees, had to explain game to two of them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Usability testing showed that players found my game easy to navigate and enjoyed the clean, bunny-themed UI, but several improvements for usability are needed. Manny struggled to read numbers due to the pixelated font, and Ella was unable to continue playing after reaching zero carrots. Additionally, two users were unfamiliar with blackjack rules. For the revised version, I will address these concerns by making changes to the UI and game logic.</p>
